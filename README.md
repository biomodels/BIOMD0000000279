**Abstract:**   
To restore falling plasma calcium levels, PTH promotes calcium liberation from
bone. PTH targets bone-forming cells, osteoblasts, to increase expression of
the cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL), which
then stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption. Intriguingly, whereas continuous
administration of PTH decreases bone mass, intermittent PTH has an anabolic
effect on bone, which was proposed to arise from direct effects of PTH on
osteoblastic bone formation. However, antiresorptive therapies impair the
ability of PTH to increase bone mass, indicating a complex role for
osteoclasts in the process. We developed a mathematical model that describes
the actions of PTH at a single site of bone remodeling, where osteoclasts and
osteoblasts are regulated by local autocrine and paracrine factors. It was
assumed that PTH acts only to increase the production of RANKL by osteoblasts.
As a result, PTH stimulated osteoclasts upon application, followed by
compensatory osteoblast activation due to the coupling of osteoblasts to
osteoclasts through local paracrine factors. Continuous PTH administration
resulted in net bone loss, because bone resorption preceded bone formation at
all times. In contrast, over a wide range of model parameters, short
application of PTH resulted in a net increase in bone mass, because
osteoclasts were rapidly removed upon PTH withdrawal, enabling osteoblasts to
rebuild the bone. In excellent agreement with experimental findings, increase
in the rate of osteoclast death abolished the anabolic effect of PTH on bone.
This study presents an original concept for the regulation of bone remodeling
by PTH, currently the only approved anabolic treatment for osteoporosis.

The model reproduces Figures 1B and 2A of the reference publication. To obtain
the figures 1B, the parameter g21 needs changes. To obtain the figures 1A, the
parameters g21, g12 and k2 need to changed. For details look at the curation

The initial concentration of Osteoclasts (x1) is corrected to 1.06066 from
10.06066.
